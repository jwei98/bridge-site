# Bridge Utilities

Built for Peninsula Bridge in order to help automate the process of elective selection for students. This process is currently done manually, which is difficult to do because there are two elective cycles.
Teachers can upload electives as well as elective descriptions and max capacities. Students can then rank electives based on preference, and adminstrator can automatically generate elective selections, rather than going through student preferences (on paper) and attempting to equally assign students.
